// MARK: - NowPlayingTracklistProvider

/// Owns the sub-track breakdown (a `MixTracklist`) of the currently-playing item and the machinery
/// that fetches it. This is the single source of truth for "what are the sub-tracks of the now
/// playing video", consumed by both the segmented seek bar (always) and the `ScrobblingCoordinator`
/// (when a scrobble service is connected).
///
/// It is deliberately decoupled from scrobbling: mix segmentation is a playback concern, so the
/// fetch runs regardless of whether Last.fm is connected. The provider is *driven* — `PlayerService`
/// calls `update(track:duration:)` whenever the current track or its duration changes — but owns all
/// the fetch policy: the once-per-video latch and the duration gate that together resolve the race
/// where YouTube reports a track's duration a beat after the track object appears.
